# Teaching Aid for Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms have numerous applications in the field of computer science.
Having a clear understanding of graphing algorithms is crucial for students. 

In this project we present a teaching tool that is used for easy visualization of these algorithms. 

* The short blog associated with each algorithm helps with understanding the theory side of things. 
* Youtube tutorials for each algorithm are linked at the end of each blog to provide more clarity.
* Functionality to publish your own articles are provided.

## Frontend Frameworks
* Sigma JS
* AngularJS

## Backend Frameworks
* Flask

## Techniques Implemented
* RSS - Implemented an RSS feed for the blog 
* AJAX - Used ajax patterns to send and receive data from the server 
* RESTful API - Used rest principles for the API

## Intelligent Functionality
* Dynamic graph rendering algorithms
* Recommendation for youtube tutorials based on current article
