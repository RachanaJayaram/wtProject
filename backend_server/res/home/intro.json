    "intro": "Graph algorithms have numerous applications in the field of computer science. Having a clear understanding of graphing algorithms is crucial for students. In this project we present a teaching tool that is used for easy visualization of these algorithms. The short blog associated with each algorithm helps with understanding the theory side of things. Youtube tutorials for each algorithm are linked at the end of each blog to provide more clarity."
